### Lecture 1
IDEAS ARE EVERYTHING, NO

- startups = idea + product + team + execution + luck (from 0 to 10’000)
- idea not much importance, but still. Bad idea can derail you.
- having a mission is better, cause it will be easier to federate people around it
- copycat companies don’t excite the public or the team
- good ideas can look terrible at the beginning (ex: Facebook: social network for moneyless students)

PRODUCT

- find a small market inside which you can have a monopoly and quickly expand
- first version of your product doesn’t have to sound very big. Product can be imperfect but has to improve rapidly
- investors make the mistake of only thinking of the growth of the startup, while they should look at the growth of the market
- you can change everything in a startup but the market
- ask “why now” (Sequoia question), why not two years ago, why not in two years?
- two things you should be doing: build a great product, talk to your customers
- most startups don’t die of competition, but because they don’t do something that people love
- do sales at the beginning cause you need to understand client needs. Great founders don’t put anyone between themselves and their users. Don’t hire sales and customer support people at the beginning
- start with a simple product
- build something a few people love, and expand to a lot of people (orange in the graph below), rather than build a thing a lot of people like, and expand to love (grey in graph)

![intensity-of-like]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/intensity-of-like.jpg)

MEASURE

- iterate around the same loop:
	1. user feedback
	2. product decision
	3. show and test
- startups do what founders measure: measure growth indicators like total registrations, active users, activity level, cohort retention, revenue, net promoter score (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter)

UGLY SIDE OF BEING A FOUNDER

- you’re responsible for opportunity cost of the time of people who follow you
- you’re always on call
- fundraising
- unwanted media attention
- you’re more committed, i.e. less option value
- number one thing is to manage your own psychology

STARTUP = BEING THE BOSS?

Phil Libin (Evernote CEO): “People have this vision of being the CEO of a company they started and being on top of the pyramid. Some people are motivated by that, but that’s not at all what it’s like. What it’s really like: Everyone else is your boss–all of your employees, customers, partners, users, media are your boss. I’ve never had more bosses and needed to account for more people today. If you want to exercise power and authority over people, join the military or go into politics. Don’t be an entrepreneur.”



### Lecture 2

FINDING HIGH GROWTH MARKETS

- Use your intuition
- watch what younger generations are using

WHAT MAKES A GOOD CO-FOUNDERS TEAM

- co-founders are the most important part of startup teams. Co-founder fights one of the main reason startups fail
- choosing someone that you’re not friends with usually ends up in disaster
- be a student or work in a cool company like google or Facebook cause it has lots of co-founders
- much better to have co-founders than solo founder
- qualities of co-founder: unflappable, tough, calm, creative, decisive, ready for anything: James Bond ;)
- If you’re not technical get a technical co-founder
- know your cofounders or early hires for years
- 2-3 co-founders good, 4 or 1 usually does not work, 5 really bad
- skeptical of remote teams: for early days, communication and speed are key. Don’t work remotely, really really tough.

WHEN TO HIRE

- it sucks to have a lot of employees (high burn rates, slow decisions, complex management). Try to have very few employees in the first year. Should definitely hire (in the early days) when dying need. Then when growth comes you’ll need to hire fast. Very bad first hires can kill the company.

EMPLOYEES SOURCE

- best source of people: people you already know or your staff already knows
- at Facebook or Google, HR sits down with new hires and goes through their network for good people
- look outside your geographical boundaries, bring people from the outside

WHO TO HIRE

- for early hires: go for attitude over experience. Most good hires are people who have never done it.
- attitude: good communication skills, manically determined, like a little bit of risk,  people who you would feel confortable reporting to.
- mediocre people in a small company will kill a startup
- lose a mediocre potential hire (who can kill the company) over losing a client (you can recover from that).

HOW TO HIRE

- took 5 months for airbnb to hire first employee
- 5 questions:
1) are they smart?
2) do they get things done?
3) do I want to spend a lot of time with them?
4) what are concrete projects the person have worked on?
5) call references, people who worked with them in the past. Really dig in: are they in the top 5% you worked with? would you hire them back? what are they good at?
- many people are bad at hiring, but good at assessing a person after they have worked with them. Try to work with people on a project before you hire them
- have a list of values and make sure people adhere to them
- have an extremely high bar, hire slowly
- founders underestimate how hard it is to get the very best people
- founders should spend 0 to 25% time hiring people.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY

- employee equity: you should aim to give 10% of the company to the first 10 employees. Founders are generous with equity to investors, less with employees. Totally wrong. Employees have more value over time, while investors write a check and tend to vanish
- At YC, companies who have been more generous with equities to employees are the most successful

CO-FOUNDERS EQUITY

- set cofounders equity very soon after you start working together. If you don’t want to give people the same equity than you, you should think hard about whether you want them as a cofounder
- pre-negotiate what happens if one of the founders leaves. In Silicon Valley, it takes 4 years to own all your equity. So if you leave after one year, you get 25% of your equity. If you don’t do that, deadweight in equity table will make it hard to find investors.

RETENTION

- keeping people: founder thinks he/she’s doing things the best but need to learn to delegate and trust people
- praise your team for things that work.
- Get people new areas of responsibilities
- be aware that as a first time founder you’re likely to be a bad manager

FIRING

- fire fast: firing people is one of the worst part of running a company. Every first time founder waits too long.
- fire fast: better for company, better for employee
- fire people who are bad are their jobs, create politics, are negative. Completely toxic to the company. Might work in a large company, will kill a startup
- one or two fuck ups -> ok, team spirit. If somebody consistently fucks up -> fire them. Fire those who are consistently doing bad things over weeks, and people doing the opposite of what you would do.

CEO HAS 5 JOBS

1. set the vision
	- focus
	- say no a lot
	- have a few clear goals
	- communicate on goals so whole company is aligned
	- always focus on growth and momentum, see how you’re doing against metrics
	- don’t get caught up in the PR, can make you feel like you’ve made it while you’re not
	- be in the same space, remote slows down the cycle time
	- indecisiveness is a startup killer
2. raise money
3. evangelize
4. hire and manage
5. make sure the entire company executes (intensity)

EXECUTION

- being a founder is signing up for years of grind around execution
- work hard, pay attention to details, care for customers
- company needs to see CEO as maniacal execution machine
- ideas aren’t worth anything, execution is where the value is
- most good funders have a small number of goals for the company. Everybody in the company should be able to say each week what the goals are.
- always keep momentum: always keep growing, don’t let your ship date slip
- relentless operating rhythm (Facebook: “move fast and break things”)
- obsession with execution quality
- every time you talk to a good team, they have gotten new things done
- when momentum is down, get small wins. “Sales fix everything”

SET AN OPERATING RHYTHM

- ship products, launch new features
- review/report metrics and milestones
- repeat

COMPETITION

- don’t worry about a competitor at all until they really beat you with their product
- don’t let your company get down because a competitor is in the press
- Henry Ford: “the competitor to be feared is one who never bothers about you at all, but goes on making his own business better all the time”.



### Lecture 3

- startups are very counter intuitive, it’s an area where you can’t only rely on your intuition
- many people ignore YC advice because they seem wrong
- you can however trust your instinct about people. Big mistake is to ignore these intuitions about people, because they seem impressive, etc
- pick people as if you were picking people to be friends with

NO STARTUP EXPERTISE NEEDED

- what you need to succeed in startups is not an expertise in startups
- what you need is expertise in your own users
- one of the risk of young founder is they will go through the motions of starting a startup, and neglect the one thing: making something people want
- universities can teach you about startups, but it’s not what you need to know. What you need to learn is the needs of users, and you can’t learn that before starting the company. You can only learn about startups by doing it.

NO GAMING THE SYSTEM

- starting a startup is where gaming the system stops. Can work in a large company (like sending late emails to pretend you’re working evenings). In startups that doesn’t work. There is no boss to trick. All users care is that your product works, you can not trick them.
- faking does work with investors. You can foul them for one or two rounds, but you’re wasting your own time cause all you’ll do is lose your time sending your company down in more time than it would have taken.

STARTUP WILL TAKE OVER YOUR LIFE

- if it succeeds it will take over a long time, 10 years or your own life
- being the boss of a very successful company has drawbacks: there are many things only you as the emperor can deal with. As the company daddy you can never show fear or weakness. As a billionaire you get no sympathy when complaining about stuff.
- as startup grows, it never gets easier. New kind of problems, but total volume of worry never decreases, if anything it increases. It’s similar to having kids, it never stops.

OPTIMAL AGE TO START A STARTUP

- don’t start at 20, travel and enjoy life first because you can’t do it later, and you’ll learn a lot
- success takes a lot of serendipity out of your life. You run your company as much as your company runs you. Serendipity gives you more options.

YOU CAN’T TELL IF YOU CAN RUN A STARTUP

- you probably haven’t done a startup when you start one
- as an investor, easy to predict if someone is smart. Hard to predict how tough and ambitious they are
- in the army, you can’t tell who is going to be successful between the arrogant and the quiet recruits. Same for entrepreneurs.
- if you’re terrified of starting a startup, don’t do it, unless you’re someone who is fuelled by fear and excels under pressure

THE WAY TO GET STARTUP IDEAS IS NOT TO THINK ABOUT IDEAS

- the way to come up with good ideas is not to make a conscious effort, and take a step back
- twitter, google, yahoo, apple, facebook were all side projects, rejected by the conscious mind as ideas for companies
- how to turn your brain into the kind that has startup ideas unconsciously:?
	1. learn a lot about things that matter
	2. think of problems that interest you
	3. with people you like and respect (how you get cofounders at the same time than the idea)
- get yourself on the edge of a technology, “live in the future”
- example: student who built voice over IP because he wanted to talk for free with his girlfriend

QUESTIONS:

- role of non technical founder? run the business side of things. For ex: Uber, non technical founder will bring domain expertise, and run sales.
- any value in business school for entrepreneurs? Not really. What business school was designed for was to teach people management, a problem you only have in startups if you’re sufficiently successful. You might be better off going to design school. Best way to learn is to start something. You might fail but you will learn.
- ideally, you’re successful before you hire your first employees. So you don’t need to manage before you have traction.
- are we in a bubble? There is a difference between high prices and bubble prices. In bubble years, VCs knowingly invested in bullshit trying to unload it on retail investors before it would blow up. That is now what’s happening today. Prices are high, it won’t be as easy as today. Bubble right now? no.


### Lecture 4

Lecture on how to get users. Disclaimer: every business is different, bring those advices smartly in your context

PRE-REQUISITES TO START A STARTUP

- Find a problem: what is it?
- Am I really passionate about that problem?
- Is it a problem other people have?
- have a lot of time to develop solutions to the problems you want to solve

THE NEWBIES APPROACH TO STARTUPS (I.E. WHAT NOT TO DO)

- build product in secret
- excessive press launch
- wait for users
- buy users
- give up
Don’t get into that cycle because you won’t get anything good.

WHERE TO START?
1. learn a lot, become an expert in a certain area, immerse yourself. Become a cog in your industry. You can become trapped into an industry you know too well, and start thinking like everybody else. But on the other side, if you’re totally new to an industry, you should immerse yourself in it to see where the pain points are.
Example of HomeJoy: Adora became a cleaner at a local company, learned how to do that job week, but more importantly, why cleaning companies would not scale, and what the market needed. Immersion resulted in key knowledge used to disrupt the industry.
2. identify customer segments. At the beginning, focus on a subset of users and really cater to their needs. You can expand to larger public later, but start with a smaller segment.
3. storyboard ideal user experience, that’s before you create the product or start coding. Not only the web site, but how customers find out about you, how they visit your site, learn more about you, then sign up, to after they finished using the product. Then put it into code, etc.

BUILD A MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT

- minimal features set. Smallest feature set to solve the problem you want to solve. You should be able to go to a person and explain what the company does in one sentence. When you start with no users, need to explain value simply.
- simple product positioning
- but this is not the hard part… getting first users is
- build fast, but optimise for now
- propose features even if they involve manual work, you’ll automate later
- perfection is irrelevant during early stage. Worry about giving a product to as many people as possible, ignore the edge cases
- beware of the frankenstein effect: listen to user feedback, but don’t build all the features you are asked. Give it a bit of time and consolidate all ideas, build only the most relevant ones.

FIRST USERS

- you and co-founder
- friends and family
- online communities: HackerNews, Reddit
- local communities: influential local community mailing lists (for ex: sites for parents)
- niche influencers
- cold calls + emails
- press

CUSTOMER FEEDBACK

- immediately after first users, make yourself easily available for customer feedback
- if you setup a phone line, have a voicemail so you don’t have to pick up
- survey ok, interviews much better. Meet people using your product, make it into a conversation. Get users at a level where they feel they should be honest with you
- quantitative feedback: customer retention is one of the key metric, but a very hard one to measure.
- qualitative: ask why, why and why again
- beware of honesty curve. People won’t necessarily dare to tell you your product sucks in your face
- you will get more honest feedback on a paying product than on a free product (click on image to enlarge)

![honest-curve]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/honesty-curve.png)


FEAR OF BEING COPIED

- S is for stealth, and stupid…
- there is a first mover advantage
- execution is the key, beat competitors with a superior product

READY FOR A LOT OF USERS?

- learn one channel at a time (Facebook ads ≠ google ads, android ≠ iOS) [See for example BuzzFeed, company organised by channel http://a16z.com/2014/09/18/a16z-podcast-for-buzzfeed-sharing-is-the-metric-that-matters/]
- iterate on things that work, get better at them
- revisit a failed channel and try to crack it at a later time

TYPES OF GROWTH: STICKY

good experience wins

customer lifetime value +  cohort analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_Analysis) important. Look at the graph below, what you want is to push the black solid line up, as repeat users buy more and more (click to enlarge)

![retention-curve]({{ site.url }}/assets/media/retention-curve.png)


TYPES OF GROWTH: VIRAL

wow experience: what’s going to make people shout about your product on twitter and Facebook?
good referral programs (where users can refer the product to their friends, and perhaps get rewards in the process):

1. touch points (where can people learn they can refer their friends? after a certain time of usage, or just after signup? Propose referring friends at point when users are highly engaged and happy)
2. program mechanics: make money when people you refer sign up
3. referral conversion flow: optimise the signup process for someone who has been referred. Might have to be a different process from traditional signup process (for ex, user will already be connected to user who referred them).

TYPES OF GROWTH: PAID

[Personal note: remember "advertising is the price you pay for being boring”]

- Search Engine Marketing, display ads, Facebook ads, groupon / daily deals, street marketing, b2b sales, direct mailers
- is your CLV (customer lifetime value) superior to your CAC (customer acquisition cost)?
- CAC = CPC (cost per click) x conversion. For ex: CPC = $10, conversion = 10%, so CAC = $100. If your CLV > 100 -> this advertising makes sense
- try to calculate CAC & CPC per customer segment
- beware of payback time. If CAC takes time to come your way (for ex: customers pay after 6 months), CPC is immediate and will kill your cash-flow.

THE ART OF THE PIVOT

- when do you decide to pivot? when growth stops, or when the business stops making sense.
- have a growth plan when you start out, try to set objectives for yourself in terms of users growth
- if you see a stagnation in the growth of users for 3-4 weeks [startup time is x10 corporate time!], then it’s time to consider a pivot, you’re probably doing fundamentally wrong.


### Lecture 5

- if you start a company, you should always aim for a monopoly and avoid competition, “competition is for losers” [easier said than done...]
- two types of business: businesses in a very competitive environment, and businesses with monopolies
- differences between these two types of businesses not obvious, but enormous
monopoly: will downplay its dominance to avoid being regulated
perfect competition: will always pretend to be doing something unique to stand out or raise capital
- Monopolies say “we’re in a huge market”
Non-monopolies say “we’re in a narrow market”
- **“the something of somewhere is often the nothing of nowhere”.**

MONOPOLY? DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK

- Google has 66% of search traffic -> monopoly?
- but if you consider Google as an advertising company:
	- $17b = US search advertising
	- $37b = US online advertising
	- $150b = US Advertising
	- $495b = global advertising
	
	So actually Google becomes a company competing with others for a share of a larger pie

START SMALL & EXPAND

- **Build a monopoly in a small market, then expand to other markets**
- Facebook: was addressing a super small market (10k people at Harvard), but went from 0 to 100% market share in a few days.
- Amazon: started with book store, slowly expanded to other markets
- Paypal: started with power sellers on ebay, expanded to the general public
- Many people miss these big companies because they start small. If you’d assess Paypal or Facebook back in the days, you’d think their market was way too small
- Companies that failed: people who wanted to address huge markets, who had tons of competitors who they didn’t even know who they were. Large existing markets = lots of competition

THE MANY WAYS TO BUILD A MONOPOLY

- The next Bill Gates won’t be building an OS. The next Larry Page won’t be building a search engine. You need to find a totally new market, or…
- Building a monopoly is not about being the only one: it can also be about being so much better you differentiate radically. **Amazon was different/monopoly cause it was selling 10 times more books than its closest competitors**
- Network effect can also create a monopoly
- Regulation / high fixed costs that prevent new entrants from coming in
- Branding
- Proprietary technology
- Build a complex, vertically integrated structure. Examples: Tesla, SpaceX, no real innovation but very good at making different things fit

SUSTAINING MONOPOLIES

- **You don’t want to be the first mover, you want to be the last mover. **Google is the last mover, Facebook is the last social network.
- You want to be the last breakthrough for a long time (ex: Google’s search algorithm outpacing competition, hasn’t been surpassed since)
- Keep improving on your product faster than people can catch up
- Economies of scale
- Most of the value of these companies exists far in the future. Paypal: most of the value in 2001 was in the cash brought by the business 10 years later. 85% of the value of good companies happens 10 years down the road

CAPTURING VALUE

- Value for entrepreneur = X * Y, X = market size, Y = market share
- technological innovation -> people coming up with innovation can get some of the value
- scientific innovation -> inventors rarely come up with value for their inventions. X = 0
- Structure of your industry is what defines your potential for success

PSYCHOLOGY OF COMPETITION

- We find it reassuring if other people do what we do
- Competition is a form of validation [This is where we go into cultural differences. True in the US, probably not as much in Europe]
- Competition does make you better
- **But competition makes people lose sight of the bigger question: is what I’m competing for worth my time?**

QUESTIONS

- when investing: don’t focus on the narrative market, but on the real market
- Google had all four advantages of a monopoly: network effect (ad network), proprietary technology (page rank technology), economies of scale (storage), brand
- successful companies didn’t really do market testing and lean startup methodology. Founders had better ideas that differentiated them from the rest of the pack. If you take too much time to figure out what people want you risk missing the boat.
