In these days I am always thinking about what should I learn to become a real full-stack developer. Back-end, front-end, mobile develepment, graphic design, management, psychology, UI/UX degisn, how to start a startup ,etc.  There are too many things to learn.  To avoiding I massing up all these thing, I think make a plan for next two month is quite important.
In next two month, besides all my school works, I am going use all my part time to finsh:

1. @MengTo's Design + Code (and also design a website and an ios app for practice)
2. Stanford's IOS developping cours
3. Stanford's How to start a startup
4. Getting familiar with Parse
5. Reviewing AngularJS
6. If have time, take a look at reactjs, nodejs, express, mean.io, mongodb
These things should be finished before my internship(except 6). If every thing goes well, I will could start build a restfull ios app and web application in next summer.

Btw, reading list:

1. The Black Swan
2. The Glory and the Dream (too long xD)
3. Asking The Right Questions -- A guide to Critical Thinking
